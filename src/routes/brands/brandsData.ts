      "ALLIMAX International Allimax International was formed on the 11 August 1999 the day of the solar eclipse in the UK however, the idea was forming way before this in 1982 when our Managing Director Norman was working as an International Water Civil Engineer, and bought Garlic The Powerful Panacea by Paul Simons, for just 80p.'Reading this book started my mission and I discovered that the mother compound allicin, had antimicrobial properties. From there I thought if it is that good, why is it not available widely? At this time, I was working as Civil Engineer in the water industry and it started my questioning why are we using Chlorine to treat water? Chlorine is a very abrasive, an aggressive chemical and strips the life out of our environment, estuaries, rivers, and sea-beds. So, I went on a quest to change how water was treated.' Since the 1980s Norman has been devoted to researching and testing the powerful properties of Garlic and is now considered an expert on many aspects of allicin’s powerful properties.Norman J Bennett, Managing DirectorAs a frequent user of garlic supplements, Norman had already become aware of the active components of garlic having a beneficial effect on good health and wellness. With the added discoveries from reading the book, the idea of using one of these active principles, allicin, was born.Little did we know that this discovery would lead us to manufacturing a world first in stabilising allicin and that the allicin, once stabilised, could be used as a food supplement. Another world first. From this ‘lightbulb’ moment, ALLIMED®and ALLICINMAX®were born.Today, we supply our unique, stabilised allicin based products to health food stores and health practitioners and consumers throughout the UK and export to over 40 countries worldwide. We continue to support research into this important active ingredient allicin and look forward to the future developments of allicin based products.",

    profile:
      "Microbz is the expression of Jeff and Sue Allen’s passion for probiotics.The journey started in 2007 when our life coaching business took a new direction. Jeff was asked to join a philanthropist who travelled the globe looking for solutions to environmental problems. His job was to mediate the potential conflicts of interest between investors and innovators, so that new green technologies could be smoothly and successfully brought to market.It was a fascinating time of travel and discovery. He saw brave new projects, from purifying oil-polluted water with electrical charges in east Africa to making clothes with healing properties in Arizona.When he got home, we took an early morning walk overlooking the Wiltshire downs. Jeff described the technology he saw that really excited him: Microbial Balancing Technology. The connection we felt, with the microbes, with each other, and with the potential of this ‘solution’ for the planet, was immediate and expansive.  We  committed  to  learning  more  and  quickly  turned  one  of  our  outbuildings  into  a  mini-brewery.The first 5-litre jars of human probiotics were trialled by us, and by friends and family who luckily were willing guinea pigs. Now we’re up to 100 and 300-litre containers, regular lab tests, online marketing and a fully functioning business, and the range of brews has grown to include probiotics for animals, for cleaning, and for gardens.Our  involvement  with  microbes  is  all  that  you  would  wish  a  love  affair  to  be:  full  of  excitement  to  be learning and growing, caring for and nurturing the brews, wishing for the best outcomes, and feeling lucky  and  privileged.  We  love  our  connection  to  this  life-sustaining  technology  that  is  endlessly fascinating and evolving, with multiple solutions for our modern life.Our  hope  is  that  every  person  who  uses  microbes  sees  a  health  benefit  and  is  aware  that  they  are contributing to the sustainability of our precious planet. “All products are natural and chemical free. They are hand brewed in Wiltshire by a dedicated team who  cares  about  creating  happy  and  healthy  environments.  Sustainable  and  effective  –  this  is  a technology everyone and everything can thrive on”.",
